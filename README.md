# Text Classification with Amazon Reviews Dataset

The task is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting the rating of a food review based on the written content of the review. The goal is to analyze and process a large dataset of Amazon food reviews and train models that can accurately predict user ratings.

The dataset used in this project consists of 540,031 food reviews from Amazon, stored in a CSV file format. Each review in the dataset is annotated with a rating between 1 and 5. The dataset is organized into three columns:
- Score: The rating given by the user, ranging from 1 to 5.
- Summary: A brief summary of the food review.
- Text: The full text of the food review.
